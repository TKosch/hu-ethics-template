\section{Project Description}
Project description following good scientific and ethical practices~\cite{greene2019better}.

\bibliographystyle{acm}
\bibliography{literature.bib} 

\section{Objectives and Schedule of the Research Project}
What are the research questions, hypothesis, or objectives of this project? Provide a schedule if possible.

\section{Participants, Criteria for Their Selection, and Method of Recruitment}
Type of participants, selection criteria, advertisement and recruitment, compensation

\section{Physical, Mental, and other Demands on the Participants or Subjects}

\section{Risks to the Participants or Subjects, Including Potential Side Effects}
Are there any demands for the participants during the study? Are they dangerous for them? What are mitigation strategeis?

\section{Compensation or Any Other Benefits Promised to the Participants or Subjects}
What compensation are going to give the participants for their participation.

% Participants will receive 10 Euro per hour, starting with 2.50 Euro for each beginning 15 minutes.\newline
% The compensation will be voluntary.

\section{Written Information Provided to the Participants or Subjects}
Describe the information provided by the participants (e.g., demographics, questionnaires, informed consent). Are they directly linked to the person? If yes, explain why.


\section{Written Consent Form Signed by the Participants or Subjects}
Before commencing the experiment, all participants are required to sign a consent form (refer to the attached document). Participants have the freedom to withdraw from the experiment at any point. The consent forms will be stored independently, ensuring that the participant's identity cannot be inferred from the data. Moreover, the consent forms will be kept separate from the collected data, securely locked away in a designated location for a duration of five years. The consent form will not be linked to the collected data.

\section{Details regarding data collection, data processing, data usage, and data protection.}
The data collected will undergo encryption and be stored securely on storage devices. To ensure pseudonymization, participants will be given the opportunity to choose a unique keyword known only to them. This pseudonym will be utilized throughout the duration of the experiment to annotate the data. Participants retain the option to request the deletion of their data, one month after their participation, by providing their pseudonym. In such cases, the data will be promptly destroyed and removed from any further data analysis.

\section{Justification for collecting personally identifiable information (according to {\S} 3 Paragraph 1 of the
Federal Data Protection Act: individual information about personal or factual circumstances of a person, such as name,
date of birth, phone number, email address). Separate information should be provided regarding the security and
potential duration of data storage.}

The collection of personally identifiable data is deemed unnecessary during the course of the experiment. Nevertheless, the experimenter will maintain a pseudonym list to establish a connection between the pseudonyms and the participant's data. Should a participant request the deletion of their data, the experimenter will promptly remove the relevant data from the dataset. The corresponding pseudonym will be deleted one month after the experiment. It is important to note that once this deletion process is completed, no further data deletions can be accommodated. Participants will be informed about this procedure verbally and through the written informed consent form.

\section{If applicable, request from a third-party funding provider for ethical evaluation, grant application, or draft
thereof.}
The ethics vote was requested by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

\section{Declaration of whether the evaluation has already been requested from another organization}
The evaluation has not been requested by another organization.

\section{Statement acknowledging awareness of the Ethics Guidelines of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences}
I acknowledge the awareness of the Ethics Guidelines set forth by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the Humboldt University of Berlin. I understand the importance of upholding ethical principles in the context of the described research project. I commit to abiding by these guidelines, promoting integrity, and contributing to a culture of ethical conduct within the faculty community.
